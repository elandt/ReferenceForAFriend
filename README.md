`git mv index.html dir/index_new.html`

Undo modifications (restore files from latest commited version):
`git checkout -- index.html`

Restore file from a custom commit (in current branch):
`git checkout 6eb715d -- index.html`

Branch
-----------

Show branches:
`git branch`

Create branch:
`git branch branchname`

Change to branch:
`git checkout branchname`

Create and change to new branch:
`git checkout -b branchname`

Rename branch:
`git branch -m branchname new_branchname` or:
`git branch --move branchname new_branchname`

Show all completely merged branches with current branch:
`git branch --merged`

Delete merged branch (only possible if not HEAD):
`git branch -d branchname` or:
`git branch --delete branchname`

Delete not merged branch:
`git branch -D branch_to_delete`


Merge
-----------

True merge (fast forward):
`git merge branchname`

Merge to master (only if fast forward):
`git merge --ff-only branchname`

Merge to master (forc a new commit):
`git merge --no-ff branchname`

Stop merge (in case of conflicts):
`git merge --abort`

Stop merge (in case of conflicts):
`git reset --merge` // prior to v1.7.4

Compare
-----------

Compare modified files:
`git diff`

Compare modified files and highlight changes only:
`git diff --color-words index.html`

Compare modified files within the staging area:
`git diff --staged`

Compare branches:
`git diff master..branchname`

Compare branches like above:
`git diff --color-words master..branchname^`

Compare commits:
`git diff 6eb715d`
`git diff 6eb715d..HEAD`
`git diff 6eb715d..537a09f`

Compare commits of file:
`git diff 6eb715d index.html`
`git diff 6eb715d..537a09f index.html`

Compare without caring about spaces:
`git diff -b 6eb715d..HEAD` or:
`git diff --ignore-space-change 6eb715d..HEAD`

Compare without caring about all spaces:
`git diff -w 6eb715d..HEAD` or:
`git diff --ignore-all-space 6eb715d..HEAD`

Useful comparings:
`git diff --stat --summary 6eb715d..HEAD`

Blame:
`git blame -L10,+1 index.html`

Collaborate
-----------

Show remote:
`git remote`

Show remote details:
`git remote -v`

Add remote origin from GitHub project:
`git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project.git`

Add remote origin from existing empty project on server:
`git remote add origin ssh://root@123.123.123.123/path/to/repository/.git`

Remove origin:
`git remote rm origin`

Show remote branches:
`git branch -r`

Show all branches:
`git branch -a`

Compare:
`git diff origin/master..master`

Push (set default with `-u`):
`git push -u origin master`

Push to default:
`git push origin master`

Fetch:
`git fetch origin`

Pull:
`git pull`

Pull specific branch:
`git pull origin branchname`

Merge fetched commits:
`git merge origin/master`

Clone to localhost:
`git clone https://github.com/user/project.git` or:
`git clone ssh://user@domain.com/~/dir/.git`

Clone to localhost folder:
`git clone https://github.com/user/project.git ~/dir/folder`

Clone specific branch to localhost:
`git clone -b branchname https://github.com/user/project.git`

Delete remote branch (push nothing):
`git push origin :branchname` or:
`git push origin --delete branchname`
